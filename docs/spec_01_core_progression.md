# SkillHero Spec 01: Core Progression & Engineering Ladder

## 1. The Engineering Path (Leveling System)
Instead of generic levels (1-99), leveling now maps to real-world engineering titles.

| Level Range | Title | Gameplay Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-10 | **Junior Engineer** | Syntax, Basic Logic, Bug Fixing (The current MVP). |
| 11-20 | **Mid-Level Engineer** | Design Patterns, Refactoring, Database Normalization. |
| 21-30 | **Senior Engineer** | System Design, Distributed Systems, Mentorship (NPCs). |
| 31-40 | **Staff Engineer** | Cross-Team Projects, High-Level Architecture, Tech Strategy. |
| 41-50 | **Principal / CTO** | Organizational Management, Product Vision, Crisis Management. |

## 2. The "Deep CS" Dungeon (The Algo-Crypt)
To teach deep CS concepts, we introduce a dungeon crawler mode.

### Mechanics
*   **Visuals:** A dark, matrix-like grid (Graph visualization).
*   **Movement:** Nodes are data structures (Linked Lists, Binary Trees).
*   **Combat:**
    *   Enemies are concepts like "Big O(n^2) Ogre" or "Memory Leak Specter".
    *   Attacks require selecting the correct algorithm to solve the node's problem (e.g., "Invert this Binary Tree to deal damage").
*   **Content:**
    *   Bit Manipulation.
    *   Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS).
    *   Dynamic Programming challenges.

## 3. Visual "WOW" Factors
*   **Evolution:** The Hero's appearance evolves not just by gear, but by rank (e.g., a Senior Dev gains a "Aura of Wisdom").
*   **Skill Constellation:** The Skill Tree becomes a 3D rotating galaxy where each star is a technology stack.
