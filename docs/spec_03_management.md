# SkillHero Spec 03: Management & Leadership (The War Room)

## 1. Overview
Unlockable at Level 30+. Shifts gameplay from "doing code" to "enabling others." Interactive visual novel / resource management style.

## 2. The Mechanics: "Sprint Command"
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Dev Points:** Team capacity.
    *   **Morale:** Team happiness (Low morale = lower velocity).
    *   **Tech Debt:** Passive damage taken every turn.
    *   **Product Value:** Victory points.
*   **Gameplay Loop (The Sprint):**
    1.  **Planning:** You have 100 Story Points capacity. Select cards from the backlog:
        *   *Feature:* "Dark Mode" (+Value, +Debt).
        *   *Refactor:* "Migrate to TS" (-Debt, -Morale if boring).
        *   *Bug Fix:* "Patch Memory Leak" (Prevents random events).
    2.  **Execution (Turn-Based):**
        *   Random Event: "Senior Dev gets sick." -> Choice: "Force overtime" (-Morale) or "Cut scope" (-Value).
        *   Random Event: "Product Manager demands change." -> Choice: "Push back" (Conflict) or "Accept" (+Debt).

## 3. Scenarios (The Soft Skills Dojo)
*   **The 1:1:** A Junior Dev is struggling. Choose dialogue options to mentor them (Coaching vs. Micromanaging).
*   **The Stakeholder Meeting:** Explaining why the refactor is necessary to non-technical leadership.

## 4. Visuals
*   A tactical map of the office/team.
*   Card-game aesthetic for backlog items.
*   Dynamic character portraits for team members that change expression based on Morale.
